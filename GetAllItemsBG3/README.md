# BG3ItemExtractor

Extract armor, weapons and usable items from the uncompressed files of Baldur's Gate 3

To use first uncompress Shared.pak and Gustav.Pak from Baldur's Gate 3 file folder which can be found at the following path
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\Data

You can use Norbyte's Extractor Tool to do that

Once this is done, launch the executable, input the path of the uncompressed files and a destination folder
This will generate Armor.txt, Weapon.txt and Item.txt

Items created through this app are their own distinct entities, duplicates of the base ones, and can be altered without any impact on the objects of the base game

This utility also generates a TreasureTable.txt that can be used for a multitude of purposes, whether for merchants or containers
